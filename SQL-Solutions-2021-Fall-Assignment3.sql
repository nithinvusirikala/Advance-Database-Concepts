\qecho 'Problem 10'

-- Consider the following Pure SQL query.

select p.pid, exists (select 1

                      where  hm1.mid = p.pid and hm2.mid = p.pid and
                             hm1.eid <> hm2.eid)
from   Person p;

-- This query returns a pair (p,t) if p is the pid of a person who
-- manages at least two persons and returns the pair (p,f) other- wise.11

-- Using the insights gained from Problem~\ref{existsInSelect}, translate
-- this Pure SQL query to an equivalent RA SQL query.

-- Step 1: Rewrite the query as follows (observe that there are 2 cases)

select p.pid, true
from   Person p
where  exists (select 1
               from   hasManager hm1, hasManager hm2

-- from clauses

 where  hm1.mid = p.pid and hm2.mid = p.pid and     hm1.eid <> hm2.eid)

-- Step 3: Introduce joins

        join hasManager hm1 on (hm1.mid = p.pid)
